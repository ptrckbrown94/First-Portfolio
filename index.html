     <p>I have great St. Paul pride, I’m born and raised in the Capital City. I went to college at Iowa State
        University in Ames, Iowa. I graduated in 2010 with a degree in Elementary Education. I then
        worked as a financial advisor at multiple financial institutions and the past year I worked in the
        private banking division at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis.
    </p>
    <p>    
        I live in St. Paul with my wife, our one year old son and our rescue dog. I love to stay active in
        my free time; walking/hiking with our dog and swimming on the masters team at Macalester
        College. I enjoy volunteering my time; I’m on the executive board at Park Square Theater in St.
        Paul and I was a member of the St. Paul Rotary Club for five years.
    </p>   
    <p>
        I look forward to working with a team to build web based applications to help clients achieve
        their business goals.
